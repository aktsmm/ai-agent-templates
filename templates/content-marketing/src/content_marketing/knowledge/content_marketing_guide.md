## Content Strategy & Planning

### Content Pillars and Themes

Every successful content program is built on 3-5 **content pillars** — broad themes that align with your brand expertise and audience interests.

**How to define content pillars:**

1. List your core products/services and unique expertise areas
2. Research what your audience searches for and cares about
3. Identify the intersection of your expertise and audience needs
4. Validate with keyword volume and competitor analysis

**Example pillars for a SaaS company:**

- AI & Automation (thought leadership)
- Customer Success Stories (social proof)
- Industry Trends & Analysis (authority)
- How-To Guides & Tutorials (utility)
- Company Culture & Behind-the-Scenes (brand humanization)

### Editorial Calendar Best Practices

An editorial calendar ensures consistent publishing and strategic content distribution.

**Weekly cadence (recommended starting point):**
| Day | Content Type | Channel |
|-----------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| Monday | Blog post | Blog, LinkedIn |
| Tuesday | Social media carousel | LinkedIn, Instagram|
| Wednesday | Email newsletter | Email |
| Thursday | Short-form social content | Twitter/X, Instagram|
| Friday | Video or infographic | YouTube, LinkedIn |

**Planning best practices:**

- Plan content 4-6 weeks in advance
- Leave 20% capacity for reactive/trending content
- Batch similar content types for production efficiency
- Review and adjust monthly based on performance data
- Align with product launches, events, and seasonal trends

### Audience Persona Development

Build detailed personas to guide content creation:

**Template:**

- **Name**: Marketing Manager Maria
- **Demographics**: 30-45, B2B SaaS companies, 50-500 employees
- **Goals**: Increase lead generation, prove marketing ROI

- **Content Preferences**: How-to guides, case studies, data-driven reports
- **Channels**: LinkedIn (daily), email newsletters, industry blogs
- **Search Behavior**: "how to [solve problem]", "best [tool/practice] for [use case]"

### Content Audit Process

Regular content audits improve SEO and user experience:

1. **Inventory**: Export all URLs with page titles and metadata
2. **Classify**: Categorize by content type, topic, funnel stage
3. **Analyze**: Check traffic, rankings, engagement, conversion for each
4. **Decide**: Keep, update, merge, or retire each piece
5. **Execute**: Prioritize updates by potential impact
6. **Monitor**: Track performance changes post-update

**Audit frequency**: Quarterly for high-volume blogs, bi-annually for smaller sites.
